This repository is connected to the study of sleep deprivation and its effects on error awareness. 
Here, we have scripts to analyze behavioral data using bayesian regression.
First, there is a script to analyze a pilot study that used the same paradigm as the main study but without the sleep deprivation manipulation. This analysis is used to estimate informative priors for some of the predictors that are of interest also in the main study.
The second part includes the script for the main study with sleep deprivation manipulatio. There, we use the estimates from the pilot study.
